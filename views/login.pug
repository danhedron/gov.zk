              Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-only way of communicating
              with people over the Internet: think of it as a predecessor to
              Slack (although it is still widely used).
          p.
              One connects to IRC networks and joins channels (chat rooms).
              In this case, the IRC network is <code>chat.freenode.net</code>.
